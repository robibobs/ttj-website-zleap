### Minecraft

Minecraft is a very popular game,  it is also hackable, in that mods can be created for it using languages such as java.  If you're using a [Raspberry Pi!](http://www.raspberrypi.org), then you can also write code to interact with a specially written version of Minecraft called Minecraft-pi.  Languages for this include, Python and Sonuc Pi.

If you have Minecraft on a desktop (PC or Mac) you can create your own mods.  Matthew is putting together some information on this.

* [Minecraft Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/)
* [Eclipse IDE](http://www.eclipse.org/ide/)

Please see mlugg on IRC or ask him at the next tech jam for information. 

#### Minetest

As Minecraft is propriatory software,  then you have to pay for it.  Thankfully the free software community have created a clone of minecraft called minetest which is equally hackable in a language called lua

The TTJ has its own minetest server, however to save system resources it is not up 24/7 so please ask on IRC.
