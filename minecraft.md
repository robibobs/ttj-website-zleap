### Minecraft

Minecraft is a very popular game. It is also hackable, in that mods can be created for it using the Java programming language.  If you're using a [Raspberry Pi!](http://www.raspberrypi.org), then you can also write code to interact with a specially written version of Minecraft called Minecraft-Pi.  Languages for this include Python and Sonic Pi.

* [MagPi - Minecraft Pi hacking book](https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/issues/essentials-minecraft-v1/)

If you have Minecraft on a desktop (PC or Mac) you can create your own mods. We are putting together some information on this - please see [Minecraft Modding](minecraft_modding.md) - but there are many tutorials on the internet.  Please review the following related resources you will need for this. 

* [Minecraft Forge](http://files.minecraftforge.net/)
* [Eclipse IDE](http://www.eclipse.org/ide/)

Please see mlugg on IRC or ask him at the Tech Jam for help or information not included on the [modding page](minecraft_modding.md). 

#### Minetest

As Minecraft is propriatory software, you have to pay for it. Thankfully the free software community has created a clone of Minecraft, called Minetest, which is equally (if not more) hackable in a language called Lua.

The Tech Jam has its own Minetest server, however to save system resources it is not up 24/7, so please ask on IRC.
