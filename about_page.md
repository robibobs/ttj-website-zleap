### About Torbay Tech Jam      

The Torbay Tech jam is designed to be a fun, informal and family friendly event.   We hope to inspire 
people,  especially children and young people to take an interest, not just in coding, but also related STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) Subjects.

We have resources such as :-

* monitors
* keyboards / mice
* Raspberry Pi's 
	* please see [resources](resources.md) page for a full list

These are for visitors to use.  You are. however welcome to bring your own kit, including laptops, pis, Arduinos. 

A typical jam is currently a mixture of demonstration, help, advice and projects (hardware and software) we encourage visitors to share their projects with others.   We are also planning talks (talks_planned.md) and workshops. 

We are also starting to become active on IRC so between jams you can drop in and ask questions and we will try our best to assist you.  Please see the IRC page for more information.

On behalf of the Torbay Tech Jam Team, we would like to welcome everyone of all ages with a passion for technology to our forthcoming events
