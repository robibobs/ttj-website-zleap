(### About Torbay Teach Jam)      


The Torbay Tech jam is designed to be a fun, informal and family friendly event.   We hope to inspire
 
people,  especially children and young people to take an interest, not just in coding, but also related STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) Subjects.


Raspberry PI

We have resources such as :-

monitors,keyboards / mice,Raspberry Pi’s,Wire, breadboard,  and a few electronic components for interfacing
 

These are for visitors to use as part of activities.  You are welcome to bring your own kit, including laptops, pis, Arduinos.

A typical jam is currently a mixture of demonstrations and we encourage visitors to share their projects with others.   We are also running workshops and planning talks on various topics.   Please see the workshops page.

We are also starting to become active on IRC so between jams you can drop in and ask questions and we will try our best to assist you.  Please see the IRC page for more information.


 

On behalf of the Torbay Tech Jam Team, we would like to welcome everyone of all ages with a passion for technology to our forthcoming events
