### Get Involved

The Tech jam is aimed at all age groups.  There are many ways to get involved and help make each jam more successful.


The jam is aimed at all ages,  at present the only two adults invovled are myself and Tom Brough. 

On the day we generally need help with

* setting up and putting things away at the end
* Technical support. this can be either with coding,  setting up new Pi, helping new users,  troubleshooting problems etc
* Talks - we have several planned for the future

However we would like to encourage _everyone_ to be involved in some way,  we already collaborate on the ttj website  to add new content, update existing content.  So rather then just attending once a month,  we can help between jams. 

Other ways you can help is to tell your friends, teachers, youth workers about the jam, what you do, and what you have achieved,  perhaps this will encourage other places to host something similar, for example as We are also looking to tie in with [Rebel Labs](rebel_labs.md) and have them integrate their activities as part of the Tech Jam.  

All these sessions need is people who are interested to co-ordninate to make it happen
