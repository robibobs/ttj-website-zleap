### Collaboration tools

One of the important skills you need to learn with projects is collaboration and teamwork. There are tools to help with this, notably from the free software world there is:

* Git
	* [Git Clients](https://git-scm.com/download/)
	* [Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
	* [Writing effective Git commit messages](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)

_Note:_ This is a command line tool for working with repository sites such as 

* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* [Gitorious](http://www.gitorious.com/) 
* [NotABug](https://notabug.org/)

Git has many powerful features, designed to make life easier for developers, even though there _is_ a learning curve to learn how to use it.
