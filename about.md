### About the Torbay Tech Jam
The Torbay Tech Jam is designed to be a fun, informal and family friendly event. We hope to inspire people, especially children and young people, to take an interest not just in coding, but also related STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths) Subjects.


We have several resources available for use at the Jams, including:

* Monitors
* Keyboards & mice
* Raspberry Piâ€™s
* Jumper wire
* Breadboards

However, please see the [resources](resources.md) page for a full list.


These resources are for visitors to use as part of activities. You are welcome to bring your own kit, including laptops, Pis, and Arduinos.

A typical Jam is currently a mixture of demonstrations, and we encourage visitors to share their projects with others. We are also running workshops and planning talks on various topics - please see the workshops page.

We are also starting to become active on IRC, so in between jams you can drop in and ask questions and we will try our best to assist you. Please see the IRC page for more information.

On behalf of the Torbay Tech Jam team, we would like to welcome anyone with a passion for technology to our forthcoming events.
